 Notes: 
 - I used Google Fonts for the page, and I don't know if that's acceptable/
 commonly used, and I also don't know if they work on all browsers.

 - The list of companies shows the description and notes (if available), and
 contact info when the block is moused over. I was going to include URL as well,
 but the URLs listed didn't actually link to anything so I left it out.

 - I would probably include the text at the top of the page in the html if the
 spec didn't say not to modify the body.

 Acknowledgements: Many threads on StackOverflow regarding hover and mouseover
 events. There wasn't one in particular or I would cite it.
