               <h3>Biography</h3>
               <p>I was born in St. Paul, MN on June 9th, 1994. Six months after that, my family moved to Austin, TX, where I was raised. I attended St. Stephen's Episcopal School from 2005 to 2012, when I graduated with honors. I discovered my interest in computer science through a summer program at Columbia University, and proceeded to take every CS course my high school offered.</p>

               <p>I began attending Tufts University in the School of Engineering in the fall of 2012 as a computer science major. This is when I joined the Tufts Tae Kwon Do team and found my passion for martial arts. I'm minoring in Multimedia Arts because it allows me to combine my love of the arts with computer science and engineering. </p>
